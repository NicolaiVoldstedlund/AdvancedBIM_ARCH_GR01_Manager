# Summary of scrips:

## Managers main script: 

This script is a simple command-line tool for running BIM model checks using different rule modules.
It loads an IFC model and presents a menu, allowing the user to select which rule to run.
Each rule analyzes the model in a specific way (e.g., facade transparency, classification, or storey count) and prints the result.

## How it works:

Loads the IFC model from a specified path.
Imports rule modules for different types of checks.
Displays a menu for the user to choose a rule.
Runs the selected rule on the model and prints the result.

## Purpose:

To make it easy to run and compare different BIM analysis rules on the same model from a single script.
